Introduction
============

mpv provides access to its internal via the following means:

- options
- commands
- properties
- events

All of these are important for interfacing both with end users and API users
(which include Lua scripts, libmpv, and the JSON IPC). As such, they constitute
a large part of the user interface and APIs.

This document lists changes to them. New changes are added to the top.
